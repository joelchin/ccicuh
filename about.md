What we do together:
- Prayer and worship

## Our Beliefs

As Christians in CUH, we affirm the historic Christian faith.  
We also draw on the *Transform Work Statement of Faith* (used with thanks â€” see [transformwork.net](https://www.transformwork.net/)) to summarise core doctrines clearly:

<div class="statement-faith">

**Transform Work Statement of Faith**  

1. There is one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  
2. God is sovereign over all things in Heaven and Earth.  
3. The highest authority for what we believe and do is Godâ€™s Word in the Bible, alive for his people today through the help of the Spirit.  
4. The dignity of all people, made male and female in Godâ€™s image to love, be holy, and care for creation, though all are corrupted by sin.  
5. The incarnation of Godâ€™s eternal Son, the Lord Jesus Christ â€” born of the Virgin Mary, truly divine and truly human, yet without sin.  
6. Redemption from sin comes solely through the grace of God, made possible by the sacrificial death of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
7. The bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, and his ascension to the right hand of God the Father.  
8. The one holy, universal Church which is the Body of Christ, to which all true believers belong.  
9. The work of the Holy Spirit in believers through the diversity of the Spiritâ€™s gifts, holding us together in the Body of Christ.  
10. The expectation of the personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

We come from different church traditions and denominations, but we share a common faith centred on Jesus Christ and the good news of the gospel.
