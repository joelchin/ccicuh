**Our Beliefs**

As Christians in CUH we affirm the historic Christian faith:

God — One God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Bible — God’s inspired and trustworthy word.

Jesus — Fully God and fully man; through his death and resurrection we receive forgiveness and new life.

Salvation & Hope — By God’s grace, through faith in Christ alone; the Spirit renews us now, and we look for Christ’s return.

We come from different church traditions and denominations, but we share a common faith centred on Jesus Christ and the good news of the gospel.
