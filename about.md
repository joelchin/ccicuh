## Our Beliefs

As Christians in CUH,, we come from different church traditions and denominations, but we share a common faith centred on Jesus Christ and the good news of the gospel.  
  
We also draw on the *Transform Work Statement of Faith* (used with thanks â€” see [transformwork.net](https://www.transformwork.net/)) to summarise core doctrines clearly:

<div class="statement-faith">

<strong>Transform Work Statement of Faith</strong>

<ol>
  <li>There is one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</li>
  <li>God is sovereign over all things in Heaven and Earth.</li>
  <li>The highest authority for what we believe and do is Godâ€™s Word in the Bible, alive for his people today through the help of the Spirit.</li>
  <li>The dignity of all people, made male and female in Godâ€™s image to love, be holy, and care for creation, though all are corrupted by sin.</li>
  <li>The incarnation of Godâ€™s eternal Son, the Lord Jesus Christ â€” born of the Virgin Mary, truly divine and truly human, yet without sin.</li>
  <li>Redemption from sin comes solely through the grace of God, made possible by the sacrificial death of the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li>The bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, and his ascension to the right hand of God the Father.</li>
  <li>The one holy, universal Church which is the Body of Christ, to which all true believers belong.</li>
  <li>The work of the Holy Spirit in believers through the diversity of the Spiritâ€™s gifts, holding us together in the Body of Christ.</li>
  <li>The expectation of the personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
</ol>
